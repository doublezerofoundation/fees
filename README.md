**TLDR: Fees have gone into effect, as of Epoch 859. Please pay each epoch's fees in the subsequent epoch (e.g. pay epoch 863 fees in epoch 864). The amounts and status of each epoch's payment can be seen at https://github.com/doublezerofoundation/fees/blob/main/fees_and_payments.csv; and please see instructions at: https://docs.malbeclabs.com/paying-fees/ to pay fees.**

This repo is designed to help Solana validators understand the fees they would pay to DoubleZero, which are assessed at 5% of block rewards per epoch.

Fees go into effect starting in epoch 859 on Solana. Shortly after each epoch ends, we will update the file here with the required payment by pubkey. Please make the payment sometime in the subsequent epoch, e.g. make the payment in epoch 864 for being connecting to DoubleZero over 863. In addition, we will post the status of paid fees as part of that spreadsheet, to help identify any gaps in payments.
